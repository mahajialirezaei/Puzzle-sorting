# Puzzle-Sorting

A small Python project that implements and compares different search/sorting strategies for solving sliding-tile puzzles (e.g. the classic 8-puzzle). It provides a command-line interface to load a puzzle, choose an algorithm and heuristic, and then solves the puzzle while reporting performance metrics.

## Overview

Sliding-tile puzzles consist of a grid of numbered tiles with one empty space. The goal is to reorder the tiles into a target configuration by sliding tiles into the empty space. This repository provides:

- Multiple search strategies to find a solution path  
- Configurable heuristics to guide informed searches  
- Detailed statistics on moves, visited states, and runtime  

---

## Features

- **Uninformed searches**:  
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- **Informed searches**:  
  - A* Search  
  - Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)  
- **Heuristics**:  
  - Manhattan Distance  
  - Misplaced Tiles Count  
  - (Optional) Euclidean Distance  
- **Command-line interface**: specify puzzle, algorithm, heuristic, and verbosity  
- **Performance reporting**:  
  - Number of moves in solution  
  - Total states expanded  
  - Time to solve  

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later  
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)  

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mahajialirezaei/Puzzle-sorting.git
   cd Puzzle-sorting
  

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python 3 installed:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

---

## Usage

```bash
python Puzzle-sorting.py [OPTIONS] START_STATE [GOAL_STATE]
```

* `START_STATE`: comma-separated list of tile values, row by row, using `0` for the blank.
* `GOAL_STATE` (optional): same format as `START_STATE`. Defaults to `1,2,‚Ä¶,N‚àí1,0`.
* **Options**:

  * `--algorithm`, `-a`: one of `bfs`, `dfs`, `astar`, `ida` (default: `astar`)
  * `--heuristic`, `-h`: one of `manhattan`, `misplaced` (default: `manhattan`)
  * `--max-depth`, `-d`: maximum search depth (for DFS/IDA\*)
  * `--verbose`, `-v`: print intermediate states and stats

### Examples

Solve the classic 8-puzzle (3√ó3) from a random start:

```bash
python Puzzle-sorting.py -a astar -h misplaced 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0
```

Run a DFS with depth limit 20 on a 15-puzzle:

```bash
python Puzzle-sorting.py -a dfs -d 20 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,0
```

## Algorithms & Heuristics

### Uninformed Strategies

* **BFS**: guarantees shortest-move solution but can exhaust memory.
* **DFS**: low memory footprint but may wander into deep, unpromising branches.

### Informed Strategies

* **A\***: best-first search guided by `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`.
* **IDA\***: combines iterative deepening with heuristic pruning.

### Heuristics

1. **Manhattan Distance**
   Sum of vertical + horizontal distances of each tile from its goal position.
2. **Misplaced Tiles**
   Count of tiles not in their goal position.
